        <h1>About Us</h1><br>
        <p>Energetic, engaging and elegant, the Brass Quintet(BQJ) of Jamaica is considered one the best
            brass groups on the island. Our versatility and musical expertise makes us stand out when
            we are asked to perform. The BQJ offers a wide range of genres and eras of music for our
            audience, while still performing it with a Caribbean flair. The group has performed at many
            outreach shows across all the parishes of Jamaica. We have also performed at many classical
            music shows within the corporate area. 
        </p><br>
        <p>Founded in 2016, the group was aimed at creating an avenue for a brass chamber group to play
            at classical music events in Jamaica, which was mostly dominated by string chamber groups.
            The first ever performance of the BQJ was an invitation to perform at the Canadian High 
            Commissioner's residence, where the group was given good ratings from notable classical 
            music performers, composers and arrangers alike.
        </p><br>
        <p>The BQJ has been a staple at the "Music through the ages" concert which is held at UWI
            every May, where there are different classical and pop groups, showcasing music from 
            the past 4 decades. Performing both ready made arrangements, and music arranged by 
            local arrangers and also members of the BQJ, the audience is always yearning for more.            
        </p><br>
        <p>In addition to be usual performers, some of the members of the BQJ are instructors at
            the National Youth Orchestra of Jamaica(NYOJ), where they are also the resident brass
            quintet. They are attuned to teach the new generation of young musicians in Jamaica. 
            They offer personal and group lessons for students and amateur players alike. The members
            also perform in other large orchestral groups such as the Philharmonic Orchestra of Jamaica 
            (POJ), the Immaculate Conception High School (ICHS) Orchestra and the Jamaica Defense Force
            (JDF) military band.
